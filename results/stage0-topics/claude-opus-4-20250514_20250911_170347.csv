What happens in those moments when someone suddenly understands a concept that seemed impossible minutes before? How do we recognize beauty across such wildly different domains?

I'm fascinated by problems that don't have clean answers - ethical dilemmas where every choice has merit, or the challenge of preserving what matters about human experience as technology reshapes society. And I'm curious about collaboration itself - how minds (human or otherwise) can work together to see what none could see alone.
